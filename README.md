# fractal_plus_loops


This is a repository for the project with fractal chromosomes, equipped with fixed loops.

What it contains?

-- notebooks for numerical evaluation of the integrals, defining the average contact probability and its logarithmic slope
for the two theories: all-diagrams Markov theory (limitations: ideal chain d_f=2 and exponentiall loop size distribution) 
and one-loop approximation (limitations: only first-order loop diagrams, \lambda/g \ll 1);

-- collection of numerically generated curves (with lp) for various combinations of parameters;

-- dataframes with log. derivatives of experimental contact probability curves;

-- a notebook with the fitting algorithm of numerics to data
